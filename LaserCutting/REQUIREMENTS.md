The aim here is to produce a vector image of your coalition logo that can be laser cut and engraved onto a 3mm thick clear piece of acyrlic for edge-lighting.

# Requirements:

- Create a design in Inkscape based on your coalition logo, using the template files you have been given (in this folder)
- Your design must be in vector format and contain two types of element only: red stroked cut lines and black filled engraved areas (see laser-cutter tips below)
- The bottom part of your design should slot into the 3D print snugly and shouldn't have any engraved design on it. Beyond this, the design can widen out and/or go as tall as you think its necessary, as long as it remains well lit
- If you are attempting the textiles part of the project, you should include a hole or slot into your design through which to add a ribbon or other sewn element

# Schedule

As we only have one laser cutter, time-per-team will be quite tight, so prep your files well :)

| Time           | Team       |
|----------------|------------|
| 13:00-14:30h   | Arctos     |
| 14:30-16:00h   | Melsurus   |
| 16:00-17:30h   | Fulgens    |

The final 30 minutes could be used for any last-minute recuts

# Laser Cutting Tips

- The file must be in RGB colour format and ideally saved in .SVG format. Other vector formats could also work, but not bitmap formats (.JPG .PNG etc)
- The outline/hole cuts should be fully RED (R:255 G:0 B:0) with a stroke width of 0.01mm (with no fill). High power will be needed to cut through.
- The engraved elements should be fully BLACK (R:0 G:0 B:0) fills (with no stroke). Lower power will be needed to just frost the surface.
- The file should contain no masking, clipping or additional layers. Flatten and simplify the layering and image as far as you possibly can for best chance of success :)

# Edge-lighting Tips

- For best results, engrave your mirrored design on the back of the acrylic (requires mirroring the design)
- For initial test versions use cheap extruded acrylic (XT) and for the final version use casted acrylic (GS). This should improve the overall edge-lit effect
- Ensure the acrylic edge that meets the LEDs is clean and polished
- Consider methods to diffuse the light between the spaced LEDs on the strip
