The aim here is to produce a 3D-printed base which can house your electronics, that your laser cut acrylic piece can slot into (for optimal edge-lighting) and that can connect to a heavier wooden base below.

It's not expected that you produce this from scratch, instead a FreeCAD file has been provided as a template for you to adapt. The model has been designed in a parametric way, such that you should be able to edit any of it's base parameters (such as width, depth, etc) and it should resize accordingly (mostly - some fine details may need adapting). Creative changes and customisations to the original design are strongly encouraged :)

Requirements:

Your final model should:
- be able to hold your Arduino Nano, LED strip and edge-lit acyrlic piece
- be small enough to print reasonably quickly (so you have chance to print a few iterations)
- contain simple feet or other connectors for easy mounting into the wooden base

Printer Schedule:

Each team has been allocated a 2 hours slot on each of the three lab printers. With good planning, this should allow you to produce up to three iterations of your design. You should aim for a rough print time of one hour, to allow for setup and fails

| Time  | Prusa Left | Prusa Right | Bambu    |
|-------|------------|-------------|----------|
| 12-14h| Arctos     | Fulgens     | Melsurus |
| 14-16h| Fulgens    | Melsurus    | Arctos   |
| 16-18h| Melsurus   | Arctos      | Fulgens

At the end of the session you will also be allowed to set one final 3D print running.

Learning goals:
- Understand some basics of how 3D models are produced in FreeCAD
- Learn how to exported a 3D model in a format suitable for slicing
- Import and slice your model using (Prusa Slider, Bambu Studio)
- Setup our lab 3D printers and print effectively
