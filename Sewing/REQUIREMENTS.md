The aim here is simply to add a single machine-stitched textile element to your trophy. One example would be a ribbon, bow or other sewn element which can be tied through a hole or slot in your acrylic piece. Another would be a small curtain, which can reveal a plaque or name badge or other design feature. But if you have your own ideas, please feel free to get creative :)

# Requirements

The finished textile element should...

- integrate well with the rest of the design
- be produced using machine stitching (not just by hand) and show basic skill with the sewing machine
- be of good quality (i.e. strong stitches with no loose ends that don't easily unravel)
