# Maker Trophy Coalition Challenge - The Basics

- You have from now until 6pm to produce an LED edge-lit Maker Trophy using a range of fabrication techniques featuring your coalition logo and colours
- You will have between 12-1pm on Thursday to assemble and display your trophy at front desk
- For fairness, each team will be given a dedicated time slot on the laser cutter, 3D printers and sewing machines. See REQUIRMENTS.md in each folder for details
- Use of the different machines will be supported by someone from the admin team - you can ask them questions and for technical help but they can't do the work for you :)
- Each team gets a lab PC to work on. Inkscape, FreeCAD and Arduino IDE are pre-installed. Laptops may also be used. FOSS software only!
- All work must stop at 6pm - down tools!
- You will have the chance to make one more 3D print each on the Bambu between 6pm and the next day (max 2 hours, set running by staff)

# The Techniques

See separate REQUIREMENTS.md in each folder below for full details of what's expected:

- [3D Printing](./3DPrinting): 3D print a lightweight base to house your and adapt the design (using FreeCAD)
- [Soldering & Electronics](./Soldering&Electronics): Light an LED strip using an Arduino Nano using your coalition colours (using Arduino IDE)
- [Laser Cutting](./LaserCutting): Produce an vector image of your coalition logo and cut and engrave it in acrylic (using Inkscape)
- [Woodworking](./Woodworking): Handcraft a wooden base to hold the trophy in place using a block of wood (using sawing, drilling and sanding techniques)
- [Sewing](./Sewing): sew on a ribbon or add another textiles element (perhaps using a hole in the acrylic)

# Points and Awards

There are points for each completed element, for the trophy as a whole and for the winner of the public vote. Creativity bonuses for each section will only be awarded if the basic functionality is in place :)
