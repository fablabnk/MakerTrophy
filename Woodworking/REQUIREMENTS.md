The aim here is to hand-craft a solid wooden base which connects to your 3D-printed base and keeps your trophy in place.

The [FreeCAD project]("../3DPrinting") in the 3DPrinting folder already includes an example 3D model of the base, showing one option of how it might connect to the 3D printed section. To ensure your wooden base will match, it's recommended to complete your 3D print first, then take the dimensions and specifications directly from the FreeCAD project to produce the base.

# Requirements:

The completed base should...
- be made from an offcut wooden piece you find in the lab
- include drill holes (or other connectors) which the 3D printed base can slot into securely
- be constructed using only basic woodworking tools i.e.
    - hand saw for basic shaping
    - sandpaper or orbital sander for smoothing
    - standing drill for making the holes
